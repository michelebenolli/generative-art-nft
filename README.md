# Nft Generator

This project allows to create a collection of images starting from a set of layers containing different assets.

It was developed for the purpose of creating NFT for collectible projects.

The library allows you to generate images every distinct possible combination of your traits.

The library also allows you to configure the image generation process in such a way that you have complete control over how rare each and every trait is.

## Usage

Upload your input assets in the `assets` folder, fill up the `config.py` file, and then run `python nft.py`.

In order to generate JSON metadata, set the JSON base information in `metadata.py` and then run `python metadata.py`.
